	journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
	abstract = {This paper uses experiments and modelling to study capacitively coupled radio-frequency (rf) discharges in pure nitrogen, at 13.56 MHz frequency, 0.1–1 mbar pressures and 2–30 W coupled powers. Experiments performed on two similar (not twin) setups, existing in the LATMOS and the GREMI laboratories, include electrical and optical emission spectroscopy (OES) measurements. Electrical measurements give the rf-applied and the direct-current-self-bias voltages, the effective power coupled to the plasma and the average electron density. OES diagnostics measure the intensities of radiative transitions with the nitrogen second-positive and first-negative systems, and with the 811.5 nm atomic line of argon (present as an actinometer). Simulations use a hybrid code that couples a two-dimensional time-dependent fluid module, describing the dynamics of the charged particles (electrons and positive ions and , and a zero-dimensional kinetic module, describing the production and destruction of nitrogen (atomic and molecular) neutral species. The coupling between these modules adopts the local mean energy approximation to define space–time-dependent electron parameters for the fluid module and to work out space–time-averaged rates for the kinetic module. The model gives general good predictions for the self-bias voltage and for the intensities of radiative transitions (both average and spatially resolved), underestimating the electron density by a factor of 3–4.}

	title = {Dynamics of near-surface electric discharges and mechanisms of their interaction with the airflow},
	journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
	abstract = {The main focus of the review is on dynamics and kinetics of near-surface discharge plasmas, such as surface dielectric barrier discharges sustained by AC and repetitively pulsed waveforms, pulsed DC discharges, and quasi-DC discharges, generated in quiescent air and in the airflow. A number of technical issues related to plasma flow control applications are discussed in detail, including discharge development via surface ionization waves, charge transport and accumulation on dielectric surface, discharge contraction, different types of flow perturbations generated by surface discharges, and effect of high-speed flow on discharge dynamics. In the first part of the manuscript, plasma morphology and results of electrical and optical emission spectroscopy measurements are discussed. Particular attention is paid to dynamics of surface charge accumulation and dissipation, both in diffuse discharges and during development of ionization instabilities resulting in discharge contraction. Contraction leads to significant increase of both the surface area of charge accumulation and the energy coupled to the plasma. The use of alternating polarity pulse waveforms accelerates contraction of surface dielectric barrier discharges and formation of filamentary plasmas. The second part discusses the interaction of discharge plasmas with quiescent air and the external airflow. Four major types of flow perturbations have been identified: (1) low-speed near-surface jets generated by electrohydrodynamic interaction (ion wind); (2) spanwise and streamwise vortices formed by both electrohydrodynamic and thermal effects; (3) weak shock waves produced by rapid heating in pulsed discharges on sub-microsecond time scale; and (4) near-surface localized stochastic perturbations, on sub-millisecond time, detected only recently. The mechanism of plasma-flow interaction remains not fully understood, especially in filamentary surface dielectric barrier discharges. Localized quasi-DC surface discharges sustained in a high-speed flow are discussed in the third part of the review. Although dynamics of this type of the discharge is highly transient, due to its strong interaction with the flow, the resultant flow structure is stationary, including the oblique shock and the flow separation region downstream of the discharge. The oblique shock is attached to a time-averaged, wedge-shaped, near-wall plasma layer, with the shock angle controlled by the discharge power, which makes possible changing the flow structure and parameters in a controlled way. Finally, unresolved and open-ended issues are discussed in the summary.}

The 2017 Plasma Roadmap is the first update of a planned series of periodic updates of the Plasma Roadmap. The continuously growing interdisciplinary nature of the low temperature plasma field and its equally broad range of applications are making it increasingly difficult to identify major challenges that encompass all of the many sub-fields and applications. This intellectual diversity is ultimately a strength of the field. The current state of the art for the 19 sub-fields addressed in this roadmap demonstrates the enviable track record of the low temperature plasma field in the development of plasmas as an enabling technology for a vast range of technologies that underpin our modern society. At the same time, the many important scientific and technological challenges shared in this roadmap show that the path forward is not only scientifically rich but has the potential to make wide and far reaching contributions to many societal challenges.}

abstract = {Abstract The propagation of energetic electrons through air is one key component in the generation of high-energy atmospheric phenomena such as lightning-generated X-ray bursts, terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs), and gamma ray glows. We show here that models for this propagation can be considerably affected by the parameterization of the differential cross section of elastic scattering of electrons on the molecular components of air. We assess existing parameterizations and propose a more accurate one that builds upon the most up-to-date measurements. Then we conclude that by overweighting the forward scattering probability, previous works may have overestimated the production of runaway electrons under high electric fields close to the thermal runaway threshold.},

	abstract = {Biased electrodes are common components of plasma sources and diagnostics. The plasma–electrode interaction is mediated by an intervening sheath structure that influences properties of the electrons and ions contacting the electrode surface, as well as properties of the bulk plasma. A rich variety of sheath structures have been observed, including ion sheaths, electron sheaths, double sheaths, double layers, anode glow, and fireballs. These represent complex self-organized responses of the plasma that depend not only on the local influence of the electrode, but also on the global properties of the plasma and the other boundaries that it is in contact with. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the conditions under which each type of sheath forms, what the basic stability criteria and steady-state properties of each are, and the ways in which each can influence plasma–boundary interactions and bulk plasma properties. These results may be of interest to a number of application areas where biased electrodes are used, including diagnostics, plasma modification of materials, plasma sources, electric propulsion, and the interaction of plasmas with objects in space.}

The excited electronic levels radiate state-dependent photons with wavelengths from the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) to visible regimes. Photon wavelengths are chosen according to a Voigt distribution accounting for the natural, pressure, and Doppler broadened linewidths. This method allows for reconstruction of the emission spectrum for a non-thermalized electron energy distribution function (EEDF) and investigation of high energy photon effects on surfaces, specifically photoemission. A parallel plate discharge with a fixed field (i.e. space charge neglected) is used to investigate the effects of including photoemission for a Townsend discharge. When operating at a voltage near the self-sustaining discharge threshold, it is observed that the electron current into the anode is higher when including photoemission from the cathode than without even when accounting for self-absorption from ground state atoms. The photocurrent has been observed to account for as much as 20 of the total current from the cathode under steady-state conditions.}

	abstract = {Monte Carlo methods have been used to produce accurate benchmark transport parameters for electron swarm transport in four model gases in the presence of crossed electric and magnetic fields, for a wide range of applied electric and magnetic field strengths. The results of the simulations are compared with those predicted by a multi-term (moment method) solution of Boltzmann's equation and by the flight-time integral method (FTI) of Ikuta and Sugai when possible. The comparison clearly validates the theoretical basis and numerical integrity of the moment method, while supporting concerns about the validity of the FTI approach and the definition of the transport coefficients used. Certain trends in the transport coefficients in crossed electric and magnetic fields are addressed using physical arguments.}

	abstract = {Fluid models of gas discharges require the input of transport coefficients and rate coefficients that depend on the electron energy distribution function. Such coefficients are usually calculated from collision cross-section data by solving the electron Boltzmann equation (BE). In this paper we present a new user-friendly BE solver developed especially for this purpose, freely available under the name BOLSIG+, which is more general and easier to use than most other BE solvers available. The solver provides steady-state solutions of the BE for electrons in a uniform electric field, using the classical two-term expansion, and is able to account for different growth models, quasi-stationary and oscillating fields, electron–neutral collisions and electron–electron collisions. We show that for the approximations we use, the BE takes the form of a convection-diffusion continuity-equation with a non-local source term in energy space. To solve this equation we use an exponential scheme commonly used for convection-diffusion problems. The calculated electron transport coefficients and rate coefficients are defined so as to ensure maximum consistency with the fluid equations. We discuss how these coefficients are best used in fluid models and illustrate the influence of some essential parameters and approximations.}

It is shown that in air at E/N ⩽ 200 Td the main contribution to gas heating occurs due to dissociation reactions by electron impact of O2 molecules and due to processes of quenching of electronically excited N2(B 3Πg, C 3Πu, ) molecules by oxygen and excited O(1D) atoms by nitrogen. At E/N > 400 Td, dissociation reactions by electron impact of N2 molecules are dominant as well as the processes involving charged particles. The fraction of discharge energy converted to fast gas heating does not exceed 40. An analysis of the experimental data on fast air heating in discharges at high reduced electric fields E/N is given.

It was shown that, in a broad range of reduced electric fields, a fixed fraction of discharge power ηE spent on the excitation of electronic degrees of freedom, ionization and dissociation of molecules is converted to fast heating of nitrogen–oxygen mixtures. In air, the value of ηE is about 30 ± 3. The value of ηE diminishes with decreasing share of oxygen in a mixture. The significant role of heat release in the pooling reactions of molecules for fast gas heating in pure nitrogen and in nitrogen with small admixtures of oxygen is demonstrated. The simulation results agree with experimental data at E/N < 200 Td within the range of oxygen content δ = 0–20.}

In dry air, gas heating occurs mainly from electron-impact dissociation reactions of O2 molecules and from quenching processes of electronically excited N2(B 3Πg, C 3Πu) molecules and O(1D) atoms. In humid air, rapid vibration-to-translation transitions of H2O and the exothermicity of the OH formation reactions additionally increase the gas temperature.

	journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
	abstract = {The results of a numerical study on kinetic processes initiated by a pulsed nanosecond discharge in air at high specific deposited energy, when the dissociation degree of oxygen molecules is high, are presented. The calculations of the temporal dynamics of the electron concentration, density of atomic oxygen, vibrational distribution function of nitrogen molecules, and gas temperature agree with the experimental data. It is shown that quenching of electronically excited states of nitrogen N2(B3Πg), N2(С3Πu), N2(a′1) by oxygen molecules leads to the dissociation of O2. This conclusion is based on the comparison of calculated dynamics of atomic oxygen in air, excited by a pulsed nanosecond discharge, with experimental data.

In air plasma at a high dissociation degree of oxygen molecules ([O]/[O2]  >  10), relaxation of the electronic energy of atoms and molecules in reactions with O atoms becomes extremely important. Active production of NO molecules and fast gas heating in the discharge plasma due to the quenching of electronically excited N2(B3Πg, C3Πu, a′1) molecules by oxygen atoms is notable. Owing to the high O atom density, electrons are effectively detached from negative ions in the discharge afterglow. As a result, the decay of plasma in the afterglow is determined by electron–ion recombination, and the electron density remains relatively high between the pulses.

An increase in the vibrational temperature of nitrogen molecules at the periphery of the plasma channel at time delay t  =  1–30 μs after the discharge is obtained. This is due to intense gas heating and, as a result, gas-dynamic expansion of a hot gas channel. Vibrationally excited N2(v) molecules produced near the discharge axis move from the axial region to the periphery. Consequently, at the periphery the vibrational temperature of nitrogen molecules is increased.}

We observe an ion pulse reaching the cathode, releasing electrons by secondary emission, and these electrons create another ion pulse. These cycles of ion pulses might lead to electrical breakdown. This breakdown is driven by Ohmic heating, thermal shocks and induced pressure waves, rather than by the streamer mechanism of local field enhancement at the streamer tip.}

title = {Anisotropic angular scattering models of elastic electron-neutral collisions for Monte Carlo plasma simulations},
journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
abstract = {Many laboratory and industrial plasma applications require accurate modeling techniques to understand the interplay between microscopic and macroscopic processes. A prime example of this interplay is how particle and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation codes describe angular scattering of electrons following elastic scattering events. The forward peaked nature of high energy electron elastic scattering is relatively trivial to accurately describe in plasma simulations. However, for lower energy collisions, which produce near isotropic or backward peaked differential cross sections, there is not a strong consensus among the plasma modeling community on how to best describe these angular scattering trends. In this study, we propose a systematic method to approximate the aforementioned non-trivial angular scattering behavior with a formula that can be readily implemented in particle-in-cell (PIC) and/or MC plasma simulation codes. The present approach is specifically applied to fusion relevant atomic hydrogen and helium, as well as for molecular hydrogen, and results are also applicable to the atomic isotopes and homonuclear molecular isotopologues of these species. Comparisons between the present angular distribution function and benchmark scattering data were used to validate the proposed models. In addition, two-term Boltzmann calculations and PIC direct simulation MC simulations revealed that the proposed angular distribution function is accurate, agreeing very well with benchmark convergent close-coupling scattering calculations, and electron transport measurements. These studies confirmed that the present angular distribution function model can be utilized without the need of renormalization to the momentum transfer cross section (as opposed to using the elastic scattering integrated cross section), which has been suggested by several studies in order to correct for deficient angular scattering models, and to agree with transport measurements. Hence, the present anisotropic angular scattering model can be utilized to accurately model the momentum transfer as well as the electron trajectories of elastic collisions.}

In this paper, the Brambring representation (1964 Z. Phys.  179 532) of the equation of continuity often used to analyse the PT experiment, is shown to be fundamentally flawed when non-conservative processes are operative. The Brambring representation of the continuity equation is not derivable from Boltzmann’s equation and consequently transport properties defined within the framework are not clearly representable in terms of the phase-space distribution function. We present a re-analysis of the PT experiment in terms of the standard diffusion equation which has firm kinetic theory foundations, furnishing an expression for the current measured by the PT experiment in terms of the universal bulk transport coefficients (net ionisation rate, bulk drift velocity and bulk longitudinal diffusion coefficient). Furthermore, a relationship between the transport properties previously extracted from the PT experiment using the Brambring representation, and the universal bulk transport coefficients is presented. The validity of the relationship is tested for two gases Ar and SF6, highlighting also estimates of the differences.}

The measurements of the swarm coefficients and the availability of the data are briefly discussed. We try to give a summary of the past ten years and cite the main reviews and databases, which store the majority of the earlier work. The need for reinitiating the swarm experiments and where and how those would be useful is pointed out. We also add some guidance on how to find information on ions and fast neutrals. Most space is devoted to interpretation of transport data, analysis of kinetic phenomena, and accuracy of calculation and proper use of transport data in plasma models. We have tried to show which aspects of kinetic theory developed for swarm physics and which segments of data would be important for further improvement of plasma models. Finally, several examples are given where actual models are mostly based on the physics of swarms and those include Townsend discharges, afterglows, breakdown and some atmospheric phenomena. Finally we stress that, while complex, some of the results from the kinetic theory of swarms and the related phenomenology must be used either to test the plasma models or even to bring in new physics or higher accuracy and reliability to the models.}

Quantitative analysis of the experimental data showed that the observed slow growth rates could not be accounted for, over the whole range investigated, by the action of secondary processes based on secondary cathode emission due to the incidence of unscattered photons, of positive ions, or of metastable atoms either separately or in any combination of these separate processes.}}

abstract = {This study details the development, validation, and utilization of a multi-term Boltzmann equation (BE) model to benchmark argon cross-section sets for their use in low temperature plasma models. First, a complete derivation of the multi-term BE model is given. The multi-term BE model is verified by comparing calculated transport coefficients to known solutions for both conservative and non-conservative model gases. A general comparison between the solutions of the multi-term BE model and the solutions of the two-term BE model, BOLSIG+  , and the Monte Carlo collision model, METHES, is also reported. The multi-term BE model is used to calculate electron swarm parameters from three independently developed argon cross-section sets, which are compared with experimental data. Swarm parameters calculated from the Biagi cross-section set feature the best agreement with experimental data, with the exception of the first Townsend coefficient, which is best reproduced using the cross-section set of Zatsarinny and Bartschat.}

LoKI-B was developed as a response to the need of having an electron Boltzmann solver easily addressing the simulation of the electron kinetics in any complex gas mixture (of atomic/molecular species), describing first and second-kind electron collisions with any target state (electronic, vibrational and rotational), characterized by any user-prescribed population. LoKI-B includes electron-electron collisions, it handles rotational collisions adopting either a discrete formulation or a more convenient continuous approximation, and it accounts for variations in the number of electrons due to non-conservative events by assuming growth models for the electron density. On input, LoKI-B defines the operating work conditions, the distribution of populations for the electronic, vibrational and rotational levels of the atomic/molecular gases considered, and the relevant sets of electron-scattering cross sections obtained from the open-access website LXCat (http://lxcat.net/). On output, it yields the isotropic and the anisotropic parts of the electron distribution function (the former usually termed the electron energy distribution function), the electron swarm parameters, and the electron power absorbed from the electric field and transferred to the different collisional channels. LoKI-B is developed with flexible and upgradable object-oriented programming under MATLAB®, to benefit from its matrix-based architecture, adopting an ontology that privileges the separation between tool and data. This topical review presents LoKI-B and gives examples of results obtained for different model and real gases, verifying the tool against analytical solutions, benchmarking it against numerical calculations, and validating the output by comparison with available measurements of swarm parameters.}

In electrical breakdown, the timescale difference between ion and electron motion makes traditional PIC methods computationally slow. To decrease this timescale difference and speed up computation, we used SLPIC, a time-domain algorithm that limits the speed of the fastest electrons in the simulation. The SLPIC algorithm facilitates a straightforward, fully kinetic treatment of dynamics and collisions. SLPIC was as accurate as PIC, but ran up to 200 times faster.

    abstract = "{An explicit electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) code with complex boundary conditions and direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) particle collisions is utilized to investigate one dimensional direct current breakdown between two electrodes separated by air at STP. The simulation model includes Auger neutralization and cold field electron emission from the cathode as well as electron-neutral elastic, ionization, and excitation interactions. The simulated breakdown voltages at various electrode gap sizes are compared to experimental data and the Paschen curve. It is found that cold field electron emission can explain the breakdown voltage deviation from the Paschen curve measured for small gaps. Breakdown in large gaps proceeds over multiple ion transit timescales as electrons created via Auger neutralization of ions at the cathode quickly stream across the gap, creating new ions which accelerate towards the cathode and release another "pulse" of electrons. If the resultant pulse of electrons is larger than the initial pulse, then this process can build up a significant quasi-neutral plasma in the gap and the voltage drop across the gap will occur primarily across the (thin) sheath. Breakdown is accelerated if the electric field at the cathode surface is large enough for significant cold field emission flux, which increases the plasma density and decreases the Debye length and thus the sheath size, further increasing the electric field and cold field emission flux from the cathode surface. Breakdown in air pressure gaps was found to be sensitive to the differential scattering cross section for electron-neutral interactions. Isotropic scattering of elastic collisions results in lower breakdown voltages at moderate gaps (several mean free paths) and higher breakdown voltages for large gap sizes compared to when more accurate forward-biased scattering distributions are used. The dependence of breakdown voltage on the scattering distribution is due to a competition between increased backscattering resulting in a larger effective path length across the gap versus changes in the electron energy distribution function.}",

The physical model incorporates electron, ion, and fast atom species whose energy-dependent anisotropic scattering on background neutrals, as well as backscattering at the electrodes, is properly accounted for. For the range of breakdown voltage 15 kV≤Vbr≤130 kV, a good agreement is observed between simulations and available experimental results for the discharge gap d = 1.4 cm. The PIC/MCC model is used to predict the Paschen curve at higher voltages up to 1 MV, based on the availability of input atomic data. We find that the pd similarity scaling does hold and that above 300 kV, the value of pd at breakdown begins to increase with increasing voltage. To achieve good agreement between PIC/MCC predictions and experimental data for the Paschen curve, it is essential to account for impact ionization by fast atoms (produced in charge exchange) and ions and for anisotropic scattering of all species on background atoms. With the increase of the applied voltage, energetic fast atoms progressively dominate in the overall ionization rate. The model makes this clear by predicting that breakdown would occur even without electron- and ion-induced ionization of the background gas, due to ionization by fast atoms backscattered at the cathode, and their high production rate in charge exchange collisions. Multiple fast neutrals per ion are produced when the free path is small compared to the electrode gap.}",

FLYCHK solves rate equations for level population distributions by considering collisional and radiative atomic processes. The code is designed to be straightforward to use and yet is general enough to apply for most laboratory plasmas. Further, it can be applied for low-to-high Z ions and in either steady-state or time-dependent situations. Plasmas with arbitrary electron energy distributions, single or multiple electron temperatures can be studied as well as radiation-driven plasmas. To achieve this versatility and accuracy in a code that provides rapid response we employ schematic atomic structures, scaled hydrogenic cross-sections and read-in tables. It also employs the jj configuration averaged atomic states and oscillator strengths calculated using the Dirac–Hartree–Slater model for spectrum synthesis. Numerous experimental and calculational comparisons performed in recent years show that FLYCHK provides meaningful estimates of ionization distributions, well within a charge state for most laboratory applications.}

    abstract = "{Quantum scattering calculations of vibration-vibration (VV) and vibration-translation (VT) energy transfer for non-reactive H2-H2 collisions on a full-dimensional potential energy surface are reported for energies ranging from the ultracold to the thermal regime. The efficiency of VV and VT transfer is known to strongly correlate with the energy gap between the initial and final states. In H2(v = 1, j = 0) + H2(v = 0, j = 1) collisions, the inelastic cross section at low energies is dominated by a VV process leading to H2(v = 0, j = 0) + H2(v = 1, j = 1) products. At energies above the opening of the v = 1, j = 2 rotational channel, pure rotational excitation of the para-H2 molecule leading to the formation of H2(v = 1, j = 2) + H2(v = 0, j = 1) dominates the inelastic cross section. For vibrationally excited H2 in the v = 2 vibrational level colliding with H2(v = 0), the efficiency of both VV and VT process is examined. It is found that the VV process leading to the formation of 2H2(v = 1) molecules dominates over the VT process leading to H2(v = 1) + H2(v = 0) products, consistent with available experimental data, but in contrast to earlier semiclassical results. Overall, VV processes are found to be more efficient than VT processes, for both distinguishable and indistinguishable H2-H2 collisions confirming room temperature measurements for v = 1 and v = 2.}",

abstract = {The ion-induced secondary electron emission coefficient (γ) is a vital parameter in the modeling of low temperature RF plasmas. Often, the value of γ drastically affects the electron power absorption dynamics, the plasma parameters and the quality of the separate control of ion flux and mean ion energy at the electrodes. Experimental results for γ under plasma exposure are difficult to obtain. Therefore, γ is either assumed to be a constant chosen with some uncertainty, or is approximated as a quantity that is a function of the ion energy and cleanliness of the electrode surface. It is hypothesized that these assumptions are not valid for all materials and plasma conditions. In this work, Hagstrum’s theory on Auger emission is suggested as a robust, ab initio model for accurately predicting γ for metal surfaces with a wide range of surface conditions and for a variety of ion species. To demonstrate the effect of the choice of γ on modeling results, we carry out particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision simulations of 13.56 MHz, single-frequency argon and helium capacitive discharges. Simulations are run assuming that: (i) γ is a constant, (ii) γ is an energy and surface condition dependent quantity that is independent of the electrode material, and (iii) γ is obtained from the ab initio model for different clean metals. The energy distribution of the emitted electrons resulting from Hagstrum’s theory is also implemented as a uniform, metal dependent distribution with physically accurate energy domain. It is found that this is important for some metals in both helium and argon. Lastly, it is observed that, depending on the assumed surface conditions, the plasma properties change dramatically. Based on these results we conclude that a realistic, material dependent implementation of γ is required to obtain realistic simulation results and that Hagstrum’s model suits this purpose.}
